## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System** that predicts the user's emotional state based on a text description (e.g., "I feel happy today") and recommends movies that match the detected emotion.

It uses:  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text processing  
- **Logistic Regression** for emotion classification  
- A sample **movies.csv** dataset  
- Simple filtering to recommend movies based on predicted emotions  

This system can be used for:  
✔️ Movie recommendation applications  
✔️ Emotion-based personalization  
✔️ AI/ML academic projects  
✔️ Demonstrating NLP + Machine Learning techniques
